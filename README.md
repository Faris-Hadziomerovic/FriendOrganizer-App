# FriendOrganizer-App

Organisational app for personal friends.

<br>Part of my learning expirience during my Walter Code university internship.
<br>Made using the MVVM pattern, WPF - UI framework, XAML and C#, EntityFramework.
<br>In the future will implement CRUD operations, but for now you can just read the existing friends and update them.
<br>Loads from and saves friends to a local DB using EntityFramework.
<br>If there are problems with the database follow the PM console commands in the guide .txt file
